[AnimSet]
; Here we defines an animation set which contains a group of animation and all the possible transitions
; This will be unique in memory, no matter how many objects use it

; First we define the complete set of animation
AnimationList = Idle#Wind

; Then we define all the links to form the animation graph
LinkList = IdleLoop#Idle2WindLoop#WindLoop#Wind2IdleLoop

; Here we specify that we can loop on idle right, but also go to walk right or idle left at once, using the immediate property

; Having defined an animation set, we can easily ask for a specific animation in code, all the transitions will
; be made by the engine without having to bother chaining them manually
; With a more complex graph, we could have our soldier sitting and asking him to run
; He would then automatically stand up, begin to run, then run without having to write any code for this to happen
; Events are sent when animations start, end or are cut so you can act accordingly if needed
